Game Functionality and Outline
------------------------------


Server:
1) While loop, forks for each new client that connects
2) Every new fork starts with recieving a command for single player, multi player, or exit
3) The second server task depends on the above response, if the server recieves single/multiplayer, the process will then accept 3 inputs from the client (First name, last name, country). Exit closes the client connection
4) If the new client selects multiplayer, it will check to see if there is already another client in multiplayer for 2 minutes and then asks the new client to continue waiting if there is no one playing or play single player
   - POSIX queue message for client currently waiting for another player
5) Game starts, it will send the client a word and give them 4 minutes to submit an answer.
6) Client sends a word which then calls the word check method. Work check method returns a correct or not correct response.
